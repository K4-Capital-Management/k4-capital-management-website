# ⚡ Quick Start - 5 Minutes to Running Site

## Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd k4-capital
npm install
```
This will take 2-3 minutes.

## Step 2: Download the Hero Video
1. Go to this URL in your browser:
   https://w25.f24.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1083066088.mp4
2. Save it as `hero-video.mp4` in the `public` folder

## Step 3: Run It
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Step 4: Open Browser
Go to: http://localhost:3000

## You're Done! 🎉

The site will work without the video (it'll just show a dark background), but adding the video makes it match GoDaddy's version.
